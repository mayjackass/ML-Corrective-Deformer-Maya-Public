## Next Steps

### 1  Test in Maya (15 minutes)

Open Maya and run:
```python
import maya.cmds as cmds

# Load the plugin
plugin_path = r"C:\Users\Burn\Documents\maya\scripts\ML_deformerTool\phase1_python_prototype\ml_corrective_deformer.py"
cmds.loadPlugin(plugin_path)

# Run installation (creates test scene)
exec(open(r"C:\Users\Burn\Documents\maya\scripts\ML_deformerTool\phase1_python_prototype\install_deformer.py").read())
```

**What to test:**
- [ ] Plugin loads successfully
- [ ] Test scene is created
- [ ] Deformer works when rotating joints
- [ ] UI window appears
- [ ] Shelf button is created

---

### 2  Collect Real Data (30 minutes)

Use one of your existing rigs:

```python
from utils import data_collector
data_collector.create_data_collection_ui()
```

**Steps:**
1. [ ] Load your rig in Maya
2. [ ] Select mesh   "Load Selected Mesh"
3. [ ] Select joints   "Load Selected Joints"
4. [ ] Click "Initialize Collector"
5. [ ] Use "Auto-Capture Range" for quick data
6. [ ] Save dataset to `data/` folder

---

### 3  Train First Model (20 minutes)

In PowerShell:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Burn\Documents\maya\scripts\ML_deformerTool\ml_training"

# First time: Install dependencies
pip install torch numpy tqdm onnx

# Train on your data
python train.py --data ../data/your_data.npz `
                --save-dir ../models/my_first_model `
                --epochs 50 `
                --batch-size 16
```

**What to check:**
- [ ] Training starts without errors
- [ ] Loss decreases over epochs
- [ ] Model saved to `models/` folder
- [ ] Both `.pt` and `.onnx` files created

---

### 4  Move to Phase 2 (Next Development)

Phase 2 goals:
- [ ] Load trained PyTorch models in Maya deformer
- [ ] Real-time ML inference during playback
- [ ] Support multiple joint inputs
- [ ] Performance optimization

**Priority tasks:**
1. Integrate `torch.jit.load()` in deformer
2. Convert joint angles to model input format
3. Apply predicted corrections to vertices
4. Add model path attribute to deformer

##   Suggested First Project

**Project: Simple Elbow Corrective**

1. **Setup** (5 min)
   - Create/load arm rig with elbow joint
   - Apply skin cluster

2. **Collect Data** (10 min)
   - Use data collector UI
   - Auto-capture elbow rotation: 0  to 120 
   - 20 samples

3. **Train** (15 min)
   - Train compact model (faster)
   - 50 epochs
   - Check training loss

4. **Evaluate** (Phase 2)
   - Load model in deformer
   - Compare with manual corrective
   - Measure accuracy

---

##   Tips for Success

### Data Collection
-   Start with 20-30 samples per joint
-   Sample evenly across rotation range
-   Include extreme poses
-   Test with corrective sculpting for best results

### Training
-   Use "compact" model for testing (faster)
-   Start with 50 epochs, increase if needed
-   Watch validation loss (should decrease)
-   Lower learning rate if loss plateaus

### Debugging
-   Check Maya console for errors
-   Use Script Editor for Python errors
-   Test with simple geometry first
-   Verify joint connections with `listConnections`

---

##   Common Issues & Solutions

### "Plugin won't load"
```python
# Check Maya version
cmds.about(version=True)  # Need 2020+

# Check if already loaded
cmds.pluginInfo(query=True, listPlugins=True)

# Unload first if needed
cmds.unloadPlugin("ml_corrective_deformer.py")
```

### "No deformation visible"
```python
# Check envelope
cmds.getAttr("mlCorrectiveDeformer1.envelope")  # Should be 1.0

# Check if enabled
cmds.getAttr("mlCorrectiveDeformer1.enableML")  # Should be True

# Check connection
cmds.listConnections("mlCorrectiveDeformer1.poseAngle")
```

### "Training very slow"
```bash
# Use CPU if CUDA issues
python train.py --device cpu

# Reduce batch size
python train.py --batch-size 8

# Use compact model
python train.py --model-type compact
```

---
