##   HOW TO USE - QUICK START

### In 3 Minutes:

1. **Open Maya**
2. **Run in Script Editor:**
   ```python
   import maya.cmds as cmds
   cmds.loadPlugin(r"C:\Users\Burn\Documents\maya\scripts\ML_deformerTool\phase1_python_prototype\ml_corrective_deformer.py")
   exec(open(r"C:\Users\Burn\Documents\maya\scripts\ML_deformerTool\phase1_python_prototype\install_deformer.py").read())
   ```
3. **Test:** Rotate the elbow joint or play timeline

### Complete Workflow:

```
  Collect Data     Train Model     Deploy (Phase 2)
                                             
   (Data UI)        (Python script)   (Load in Maya)
```
